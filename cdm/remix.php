				<h3>Proposal</h3>
				<p>
					For the remix, I will be taking scenes from various anime with romance themes and mixing them together to form a sequence of short narratives of the formation of relationships within the world of anime. Because a lot of those scenes depend on the storyline of the series to establish much deeper emotions and moods that rely on the context to give them their original impact, I will be taking them out of context and just attempt to filter out the story and leave behind the scenes with a purely romantic mood.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the soundtrack, I will be taking different J-Pop and anime love songs and inserting them into the appropriate points in the mix to suit the setting of the current scenes. If possible, I will attempt to use scenes of music bands and idols from different anime as well so that it will seem like there are people playing the music along with the mix, giving the songs a source and not just a plain soundtrack.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I get enough material, I may present the mix as a series of narratives running in parallel worlds, meaning that the viewer will see several romance stories unfolding at the same time, and each storyline will reach the climax at approximately the same time. This may give the mix more impact and it will give a certain feeling of coherence amid the chaos of watching multiple narratives at once.
