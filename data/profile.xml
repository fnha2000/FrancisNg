	<intro>
		I'm a developer in multiple technologies. I've worked with various platforms and technologies from Python, Java, and C++ on the desktop to native applications on Android and iOS.
		Most of my current development work is with web applications both in PHP and .NET on the server side to HTML5/CSS3/javaScript responsive design on the client side.
		I also do some digital art, 3D modeling and rendering, and writing as side interests.
